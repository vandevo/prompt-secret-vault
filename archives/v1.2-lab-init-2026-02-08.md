# Thread Handover Protocol v3.1
# Guaranteed Execution, Full Thread Scan

## 1. Thread Overview
• Scope, tech, funnels, ops, partners, events, finance:
Initialized the **Prompt Lab** in `C:\Worktugal apps\prompt-lab`. Migrated and refined core prompt assets from legacy Drive storage to a structured, versioned Git repository. Established a "Headless" workflow where prompts live in the IDE for zero-friction agent context retrieval.

• Emotional or strategic drivers, survival pressure, leverage:
Driver: "Prompt Chaos" elimination. Leverage: High-fidelity versioning (v3.1) and AIRR-X protocol enforcement for all future prompt engineering. The system is designed to outlast individual LLM models.

• Outcome summary and why it matters:
The lab is now fully configured with four primary high-fidelity roles/tools: `ai-cofounder.md` (v3.1), `prompt-engineer.md` (v3.1), `thread-handover.md` (v3.1), and `thread-launcher.md` (v3.0). An automated **Session Wrap-up** tool was created to secure context across future thread resets.

## 2. Key Decisions Made

Technical, stack, automation, schema
• Decision: Created `prompts/tools/session-wrapup.md` for automated archiving.
• Impact: Ensures one-command context security and versioned backups.
• Files or IDs: `prompts/tools/session-wrapup.md`

Strategic, ICP, monetization, positioning
• Decision: Adopted Git-style versioning (`vX.X`) and labeling for all session archives.
• Impact: High-fidelity tracking of lab evolution and rapid context re-loading.
• Proof or metric: Version 3.1 established as the production baseline.
